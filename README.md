A fully working **RFID-based electronic voting system** developed using **STM32CubeIDE**,  
**MFRC522 RFID Reader (SPI)**, **SSD1306 OLED Display (I2C – register level)**,  
**Potentiometer (ADC)** for selecting candidates, and **Push Button + Buzzer** for UI controls.

This project demonstrates an embedded, real-time, secure voting flow where each authorized RFID card can vote only once.

## 📌 Features

- ✔ **RFID-based voter authentication** using MFRC522  
- ✔ **OLED UI** using SSD1306 (Register-level I2C implementation)  
- ✔ **Potentiometer for candidate selection** (ADC on PA1)  
- ✔ **Push-button for vote confirmation**  
- ✔ **Buzzer feedback** for valid/invalid card  
- ✔ **Anti-double-voting logic** (each authorized UID can vote only once)  
- ✔ **Shows total vote count** on long button press  
- ✔ **LED activity indicator** for RFID scans  
- ✔ Fully working STM32CubeIDE project included in repo
